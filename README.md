# Udacity-Deep-Learning-NanoDegree

This repository contains all projects submitted for my [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://confirm.udacity.com/5YGQQKCR) course. 
In this coursd we learnt several topics like basics of neural network, gradient descent, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN),
Long-Short Term memory(LSTM), Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN) and deplyment on AWS Sagemaker and the projects showcase the skills we learnt.

We did 5 projects in total during the course of this project. They are:
1) **Predict Bike Sharing Patterns**(Project 1): This project I learnt the basics of training a neural network, the math behind gradient descent. 

2) **Dog Breed classifier**(Project 2): Given an image of a dog, the classifier can identify the breed of the dog using CNN.

3) **TV Script generation**(Project 3):In this project, we generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We used  Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new, TV script.

4) **Generate faces**(Project 4): Using GANs to generate new faces.

5) **Deployment**(Project 5): Deployed Sentiment Analysis model to predict the sentiment of a movie review from IMDB dataset using RNN on AWS Sagemaker and building a simple web app using HTML for interaction with the model.
